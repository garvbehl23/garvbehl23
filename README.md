## About Me

I’m a machine learning and AI enthusiast currently working on cutting-edge problems in natural language processing, privacy-preserving computing, and image-based classification systems.

My projects blend research-level exploration with production-level implementation. Whether it's building secure cryptographic protocols in Rust or achieving high-accuracy image classification models, I aim to build things that are robust, scalable, and meaningful.

## Current Focus

- Building NLP and LLM-based solutions using transformer models.
- Developing privacy-preserving computation protocols (e.g., garbled circuits).
- Researching secure and efficient system-level implementations using Rust.
- Applying deep learning to grayscale image classification with high performance (97%+ accuracy).
